# Side Project
This is my repository for my "Pygame Tutorial" project, 
the fifth project that I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

## Pygame Tutorial Project
This was a YouTube tutorial project that I used to get aquainted with the `Pygame` module.
It consists of a player controlled avatar that can move left and right, jump, and can shoot.
There is an enemy goblin that walks back and forth on a path that will eliminate the player if the two collide.
There is a score value printed in the top right corner that counts +1 per player shot hit, and -5 for everytime the player and goblin collide.
